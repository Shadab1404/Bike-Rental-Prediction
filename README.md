# Bike-Rental-Prediction
Dataset: The dataset contains Daily Bike Rental in terms of various characteristics imported from UCI Machine Learning Repository named Seoul Bike Data. The dataset contains 8760 number of bike rents data on 13 different factors on numbers of bike rents.

Objective: We built an algorithm that uses all numerical and categorical variables for predicting the number of bike rents.
Compared different model accuracy and Mean Squared Error and Cross Validation model accuracy and Mean Squared Error, and we find random forest model predicts best the number of bike rents.
